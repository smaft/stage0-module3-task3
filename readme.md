## Tasks:

#### 1) Basic variable initialization.

Create 3 int variables with names: first, second, third. Initialize them with
values: 1, 10, 100. Make console outputs for all of them, each on new line. Implement the program inside of given code
snippet:

    public class BasicVariablesInitialization {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
             //write code here
        }
    }

#### 2) One-line variable declaration and initialization.

Declare 3 int variables within one statement and call them a, b, c (order must be followed). Initialize them in one
statement with value "10". Print to console "c". Implement the program inside of given code snippet:

    public class DeclaringVars {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
            //write code here 
       }
    }

#### 3) Reassigning references.

Declare another 3 variables: first, second, third (1,10,100). Make console output of 3
initial vars (first, second, third) each on new line. Initialize vars first = 1;
second = 10;
third = 100;
System.out.println("first\nsecond\nthird"); with the
variables first, second, third. Reassign (first, second, third) with the : 15, 6, 4. And write to console all the
variables (in the order they were declared), each on a new line. Pay attention to results.
Implement the program inside of given code snippet:

    public class ReassigningValues {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
            //write code here 
       }
    }
